# 2017-05-02 EMC measurement

This measurement was the third one, but the the first time we passed the EMC tests!

The following is the screenshot of the relevant graph:

This may look like a fail, but it's not! There are two peaks that are above the safety zone, but as it turns out, there are two measurements involved. In the first measurement, the peaks get detected. In the second, the peaks are more closely investigated which usually results in considerably lower values. The final values are marked with blue rectangles below the peaks, and they're all within the safety zone.

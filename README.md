# EMC tests

This repository contains the EMC test results of the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/).

Every measurement is available in two formats: XLS and PNG.

The XLS files contain the actual data points, but these spreadsheets heavily use macros which makes the graphs only appear in Microsoft Excel.

The PNG files are merely the screenshots of the Excel graphs.

We will be updating this repo as new measurements take place.
